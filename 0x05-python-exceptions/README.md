# Python - Error Handling

## Description

In this project, we explore error handling and exception management in Python. A series of Python scripts are included, each focusing on a specific aspect of error handling, demonstrating how to handle errors and exceptions gracefully.

## Task Descriptions

### safe_print_list.py

- **Description:** This script defines a function, `safe_print_list`, that safely prints elements from a list. It handles `IndexError` by breaking out of the loop when necessary.

### safe_print_integer.py

- **Description:** This script defines a function, `safe_print_integer`, for printing integers safely using the `"{:d}".format()` method. It handles `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions.

(Continue this pattern for the remaining scripts...)

## Installation

These scripts can be run using any Python 3 interpreter. No specific installation is required.

## Usage

Each script focuses on a specific aspect of error handling and can be executed independently. Detailed usage instructions are provided in the individual task descriptions.
