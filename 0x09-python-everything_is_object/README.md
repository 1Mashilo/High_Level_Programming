# Python - Everything is Object

![Project Image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/252/r_208403_QPSN8.jpg)

In this project, I explored the fundamental concept that "Everything is an Object" in Python. i delved into object instantiation, variable aliasing, object identifiers, types, mutability, and memory management. To reinforce my comprehension of these concepts, i engaged in a series of quiz-like questions, where i provided concise and accurate answers in single-line .txt files.

## Object Identification and Types

### 0. Who am I?

- [0-answer.txt](./0-answer.txt): In this task, we identify the function used to print the type of an object.

### 1. Where are you?

- [1-answer.txt](./1-answer.txt): This task explores how to obtain the memory address (identifier) of a variable in Python's CPython implementation.

## Object Aliasing

### 2. Right count

- [2-answer.txt](./2-answer.txt): Determine whether two variables `a` and `b` point to the same object.

### 3. Right count =

- [3-answer.txt](./3-answer.txt): Investigate if two variables `a` and `b` point to the same object.

### 4. Right count =

- [4-answer.txt](./4-answer.txt): Examine if two variables `a` and `b` point to the same object.

### 5. Right count =+

- [5-answer.txt](./5-answer.txt): Determine whether two variables `a` and `b` point to the same object.

### 6. Is equal

- [6-answer.txt](./6-answer.txt): Predict the output of code involving string objects and the equality operator.

### 7. Is the same

- [7-answer.txt](./7-answer.txt): Predict the output of code comparing two string objects using the `is` operator.

### 8. Is really equal

- [8-answer.txt](./8-answer.txt): Anticipate the output of code comparing two identical string objects with the equality operator.

### 9. Is really the same

- [9-answer.txt](./9-answer.txt): Forecast the output of code comparing two identical string objects with the `is` operator.

## Lists and Mutability

### 10. And with a list, is it equal

- [10-answer.txt](./10-answer.txt): Determine the outcome of code comparing two lists for equality.

### 11. And with a list, is it the same

- [11-answer.txt](./11-answer.txt): Ascertain whether two list variables point to the same object.

### 12. And with a list, is it really equal

- [12-answer.txt](./12-answer.txt): Analyze code comparing two list variables for equality.

### 13. And with a list, is it really the same

- [13-answer.txt](./13-answer.txt): Assess whether two list variables point to the same object.

### 14. List append

- [14-answer.txt](./14-answer.txt): Predict the output of code involving list operations.

### 15. List add

- [15-answer.txt](./15-answer.txt): Determine the outcome of code that modifies lists and variables.

## Variables and Memory Management

### 16. Integer incrementation

- [16-answer.txt](./16-answer.txt): Anticipate the output of code involving integer variables.

### 17. List incrementation

- [17-answer.txt](./17-answer.txt): Assess the impact of a function that modifies a list.

### 18. List assignation

- [18-answer.txt](./18-answer.txt): Predict the output of code that assigns list values to variables.

### 19. Copy a list object

- [19-copy_list.py](./19-copy_list.py): Implement a Python function `def copy_list(l):` that returns a copy of a list.

## Tuples in Python

### 20. Tuple or not?

- [20-answer.txt](./20-answer.txt): Determine whether a variable `a` is a tuple.

### 21. Tuple or not?

- [21-answer.txt](./21-answer.txt): Identify whether a variable `a` is a tuple.

### 22. Tuple or not?

- [22-answer.txt](./22-answer.txt): Ascertain whether a variable `a` is a tuple.
