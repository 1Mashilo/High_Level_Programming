# Python Scripts - Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each script corresponds to a specific topic, starting with the basics of creating classes and objects and progressing to more advanced concepts.

## Learning Objectives

These scripts cover the following learning objectives:

1. **Class and Object**: Introduction to classes and objects, including how to create them and their basic properties.
2. **Constructor (__init__)**: Understanding the constructor method (`__init__`) for initializing objects.
3. **Attributes and Encapsulation**: Exploring attributes and encapsulation, including private attributes.
4. **Methods**: Introduction to class methods and their usage.
5. **Properties**: Understanding the concept of properties and how to use them.
6. **Positional and Default Arguments**: Using positional and default arguments in methods.
7. **Magic Methods**: Implementing magic methods for customizing object behavior.
8. **Singly-Linked List**: A simple implementation of a singly-linked list.
9. **Comparisons**: Custom comparisons for objects.
10. **MagicClass**: A class that matches a specific bytecode, demonstrating byte code compilation.

## Scripts

- [0-square.py](0-square.py): Basic class definition.
- [1-square.py](1-square.py): Class with an `__init__` method and private attributes.
- [2-square.py](2-square.py): Improved class with attribute validation.
- [3-square.py](3-square.py): Added a method to calculate the area.
- [4-square.py](4-square.py): Using properties to access and validate attributes.
- [5-square.py](5-square.py): Enhanced class with a `my_print` method.
- [6-square.py](6-square.py): Class with position support for `my_print`.
- [100-singly_linked_list.py](100-singly_linked_list.py): Implementation of a singly-linked list with sorted insertion.
- [101-square.py](101-square.py): Enhanced square class with customizable `__str__` method.
- [102-square.py](102-square.py): Square class with additional comparisons.
- [103-magic_class.py](103-magic_class.py): A class matching a specific bytecode, used for bytecode compilation demonstration.

## Usage
These classes are educational tools for understanding OOP concepts in Python. You can import and use them in your Python programs. Each class provides specific functionality and can be customized as needed. Refer to the individual class files for usage examples and documentation.
